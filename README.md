## Music Recommendation System implemented using ALS 

ALS Matrix factorization is a class of collaborative filtering algorithms used in recommender systems. Matrix factorization algorithms work by decomposing the user-item interaction matrix into the product of two lower dimensionality rectangular matrices. Using this approach, our recommender system recommends top 5 music artists for the user.
